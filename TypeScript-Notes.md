## Type assignment

* We can use colons after any variable to say the file that we wamt that particular datatype only.
* This will help us to avoid unexpected output, like in adding 2 numbers both must be *numbers* and not *strings*.

## Type Inference
* This assures that any variable does have same datatype.
* If we try to assign different datatype value to that variable , then it'll throw error.

## Types of JS and TS
* TS is static type (fixes during development) and JS is dynamic type (resolved at runtime).

## Core datatypes
* Number , boolean and string are the core datatypes in TS
